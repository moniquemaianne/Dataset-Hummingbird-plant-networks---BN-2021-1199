This database contains information on interactions between plants and hummingbirds in the Serra da Canastra National Park from November 2018 to October 2019 in two phytophysiognomies, rupestrian grasslands and riparian forests. 
The database contains the script used to calculate interaction network metrics and the table with the input data, characterized by the phytophysiognomy in which the interaction was recorded, identity of hummingbird and plant species and total interactions between the pairs of species during the data collection. 
For the analysis I used R Studio version 2020.
